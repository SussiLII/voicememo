We can use LRM to detect whether we should take some actions, whether we should send a coupon to the user to prevent change. These are the various use cases we've done in the event-driven space. Thank you. We have time for two questions, if anyone. I have a comment actually. So I see all over LinkedIn with the new AI export saying that SQL is dead. Is SQL dead? That's a very good question. I actually have a, so basically I came from, before I was talking about, I was at NMS, Redshift. Never know Redshift dancing while that's still playing. And it's really cool actually. Redshift is basically the universe in the warehouse. So I actually have a lot of our colleagues working on this for our systems, and they actually know the tech tools. They also build tech tools. But the challenge here, and that's what the main challenge for tech tools is not about the model. It's actually more about for the the quality of your descriptions. Basically, you create a table, right? So let's say that if you're using Neo, we have a very good . And if you create a table in Neo, the issue here is that you never write the comments to describe your table. So essentially, even if you ask a question in Neo, the problem here is that the Chinese media doesn't really understand what a table really means. And it could just give suggestions or it could probably just guess based on a column name. So this makes the quality of the translation very, very low, which makes it basically useless. I mean, if you are diligent enough, and if you're ready, not comments. I have to say that for the . Thank you so much. Thank you. So next speaker is from OpenAI, and while he gets things set up, I have one request for you all, so do not make any video out of this talk. You can take pictures, as many as you want, but no videos for this talk.
