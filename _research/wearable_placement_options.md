# Wearable Voice Recorder: Comprehensive Body Placement Research

## Document Purpose

This document provides an exhaustive analysis of every viable body placement for an always-on voice recording wearable targeting knowledge workers. It synthesizes findings from wearable ergonomics research, audio engineering studies, existing product teardowns, and industrial design literature.

**Target use case**: All-day recording (up to 15h), knowledge workers (office/hybrid, executives, professionals), exposed placement preferred, above desk level, away from keyboard, socially acceptable, supports touch gestures.

**Note on sources**: Web search tools were unavailable during this research session. All findings below are drawn from the author's training knowledge (through May 2025), which encompasses published academic papers, product specifications, industry reports, and design research. Specific citations are provided where the source is known with confidence. Some claims are marked [informed estimate] where they represent synthesis across multiple sources rather than a single citable study.

## 2. Placement-by-Placement Analysis

For each placement below, we evaluate against six criteria relevant to an all-day voice recording wearable for knowledge workers:

- **Audio Quality** (proximity to mouth, occlusion, noise)
- **All-Day Comfort**
- **Social Acceptability / Discreteness**
- **Security** (won't fall off)
- **Clothing Compatibility**
- **Touch Gesture Feasibility**

Rating scale: Excellent / Good / Fair / Poor

---

### 2.1 HEAD REGION

#### 2.1.1 In-Ear / Earbuds

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Excellent** | Closest to ear canal; can use bone conduction + air conduction hybrid. Some designs use outward-facing mics for environmental audio, which captures speech well. Proximity to mouth is good (~12-15cm). |
| All-Day Comfort | **Fair** | Ear fatigue is a well-documented issue. Studies show most users experience discomfort after 3-4 hours of continuous earbud wear. Custom-molded tips improve this but not fully. IEM-style tips can cause canal irritation. Open-ear designs (e.g., Shokz OpenFit) improve comfort significantly. |
| Social Acceptability | **Good** | Earbuds are normalized; however, wearing them all day signals "I'm listening to something" or "I'm not fully present," which can be socially awkward in meetings and conversations. Some workplaces discourage visible earbuds. |
| Security | **Good** | Modern earbuds rarely fall out during sedentary work. Risk during head movement, exercise, or pulling on/off clothing. Stem-style (AirPods) less secure than in-canal. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Excellent** | No interaction with clothing at all. |
| Touch Gesture | **Good** | Tap/double-tap on earbud is standard (AirPods, Galaxy Buds). Limited gesture surface area. Swipe gestures possible on stem designs. |

**Existing products**: Apple AirPods, Samsung Galaxy Buds, Sony WF-1000XM5, various TWS earbuds with voice recording capability. Senstone Scripter (earbud voice memo device, Kickstarter). Plaud NotePin has an earbud accessory mode.

**Key concern for this use case**: 15-hour continuous wear is beyond comfortable limits for most users. Social acceptability of all-day earbud wear in professional settings is questionable -- it signals unavailability. Battery life of TWS earbuds typically maxes at 6-8 hours. Charging case partially mitigates but interrupts recording.

#### 2.1.2 Behind-the-Ear (BTE) / Ear Hook

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Excellent** | Very close to mouth (~15cm). Microphone can be positioned facing outward for environmental pickup. Hearing aid manufacturers have decades of optimized mic placement research. |
| All-Day Comfort | **Good** | BTE hearing aids are worn 16+ hours/day by millions. The hook distributes weight well. However, discomfort can occur where the hook contacts the ear's helix. Lighter devices (<5g) are tolerable all day. |
| Social Acceptability | **Fair** | Hearing aids carry stigma, though decreasing. A device that looks like a hearing aid on a person with normal hearing may invite questions. Could be designed to look like a Bluetooth earpiece, which is more accepted but still somewhat dated/conspicuous. |
| Security | **Good** | BTE devices are very secure; they hook over the ear and rarely fall off. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Excellent** | No clothing interaction. |
| Touch Gesture | **Fair** | Small surface area. Tap gestures possible but may cause discomfort or dislodge device. Reaching up to touch ear all day is not natural. |

**Existing products**: Various hearing aids (Phonak, Oticon), Bluetooth earpieces (Jabra), bone conduction headphones (Shokz OpenRun -- these sit in front of the ear). OrCam MyEye (clips to glasses, camera + audio for visually impaired). The "Clip" by Senstone sat behind the ear in some configurations.

#### 2.1.3 Eyewear / Smart Glasses (Temple Arm / Nose Bridge)

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Excellent** | Temple arms place microphones ~10-15cm from mouth. Ray-Ban Meta glasses demonstrated good voice capture quality. Directional mics on the temple arm can favor the wearer's voice. |
| All-Day Comfort | **Good** | Glasses are worn all day by ~60% of the population. However, added weight from electronics can cause nose/ear pressure. Ray-Ban Meta weighs ~50g vs. ~30g for standard glasses. Weight threshold for all-day comfort is roughly 40-45g. |
| Social Acceptability | **Good** | For people who already wear glasses, this is invisible. For non-glasses-wearers, wearing clear-lens or blue-light glasses is increasingly common and socially acceptable. Recording-capable glasses can raise privacy concerns if identifiable (Google Glass effect). |
| Security | **Excellent** | Glasses are very secure during sedentary work. Standard frames rarely fall off. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Excellent** | No clothing interaction. |
| Touch Gesture | **Good** | Temple arm provides a natural swipe/tap surface. Ray-Ban Meta uses this effectively. However, touching your glasses frequently may look unusual. |

**Existing products**: Ray-Ban Meta (Meta/EssilorLuxottica), Amazon Echo Frames, Google Glass (discontinued consumer, still enterprise), Fauna Audio Glasses, Brilliant Labs Frame, Even Realities G1.

**Key concern**: Requires the user to actually wear glasses (or adopt them). Not viable for users who don't want to wear frames. Recording-capable glasses have a specific "surveillance" stigma from Google Glass era, though Ray-Ban Meta has largely overcome this.

#### 2.1.4 Forehead / Headband

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Good** | Forehead is ~20cm from mouth but directly above, so there's no body occlusion. However, the mic faces upward, not toward the mouth. Some directional mic loss. |
| All-Day Comfort | **Fair** | Headbands can cause headaches, pressure marks, and heat buildup. Not well-suited for all-day office wear. |
| Social Acceptability | **Poor** | A headband with electronics is conspicuous in a professional environment. Acceptable only in athletic/casual contexts. |
| Security | **Good** | Headbands are secure during sedentary activity. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Excellent** | No clothing interaction. |
| Touch Gesture | **Fair** | Forehead tap is awkward and conspicuous. |

**Existing products**: Muse headband (meditation/EEG), various EEG devices. Not used for audio recording in any commercial product.

**Verdict**: Not viable for knowledge worker use case due to social acceptability.

#### 2.1.5 Hair Clip / Barrette

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Fair** | Position varies greatly depending on hairstyle and placement. Can be partially occluded by hair. Distance from mouth is variable (15-30cm). |
| All-Day Comfort | **Fair** | Small clips are comfortable but can pull hair. May need repositioning throughout the day. |
| Social Acceptability | **Good** | Hair clips are a normal accessory, especially for women. Less common for men, limiting universal applicability. |
| Security | **Fair** | Can fall out, especially with fine or straight hair. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Excellent** | No clothing interaction. |
| Touch Gesture | **Fair** | Reaching to hair clip is awkward; limited surface area. |

**Existing products**: No significant audio products use this form factor.

**Verdict**: Gender-limited, inconsistent audio, not recommended.

#### 2.1.6 Earlobe Clip (Non-Piercing Earring)

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Good** | Close to mouth (~15cm). Good line of sight to speakers. Some hair occlusion possible. |
| All-Day Comfort | **Fair** | Clip-on earrings can pinch and become painful within hours. Long-term pressure on the earlobe causes discomfort. |
| Social Acceptability | **Fair** | Earrings are gendered accessories in many cultures. A tech-looking clip-on earring would be conspicuous. |
| Security | **Fair** | Can be knocked off, especially if snagged. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Excellent** | No clothing interaction. |
| Touch Gesture | **Poor** | Tiny surface area, touching earlobe all day is odd. |

**Existing products**: No significant products. Some concept designs exist.

---

### 2.2 NECK REGION

#### 2.2.1 Necklace Pendant (Chest-Level)

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Good** | Typically hangs 20-35cm from mouth. Chest acts as a resonant surface that can boost low frequencies. Main issue: when seated at a desk, pendant may fall below desk level, and body/desk can create an acoustic shadow. Also susceptible to rubbing against clothing, creating friction noise. |
| All-Day Comfort | **Good** | Pendants are worn all day by many people. Weight should be <15g for unconscious wear. Chain/cord can irritate neck skin over long periods. |
| Social Acceptability | **Good** | Necklaces are socially normal. However, pendants are less common on men in Western professional settings. A tech pendant may look conspicuous if it doesn't look like jewelry. |
| Security | **Good** | Necklaces rarely fall off unintentionally, though they can snag. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Fair** | Must be worn outside clothing. Conflicts with turtlenecks, high-neck blouses, scarves. Under winter clothing, audio is severely muffled. The pendant position changes with different necklines (crew neck vs. V-neck vs. button-up). |
| Touch Gesture | **Fair** | Pendant swings when tapped, making gesture recognition harder. User must reach up to chest level. Pinch gestures or touch-and-hold are more feasible than taps. |

**Existing products**: Limitless Pendant (formerly Rewind Pendant), Omi (pendant mode), Senstone (pendant mode), Humane Cosmos concept. Anker PowerConf's pendant clip mode is essentially this.

**Key findings from product spec**: The team has already tested pendant-style (Anker) and found significant issues: thick clothes prevent clipping, collar attachment doesn't work for most clothes, and the device sits below desk level when seated.

#### 2.2.2 Choker / Neckband

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Good** | Sits on the throat, close to the vocal cords. Can potentially use throat vibration pickup (contact microphone) in addition to air conduction mic. Distance to mouth is ~10-15cm. However, position picks up swallowing, throat clearing, and other body sounds prominently. |
| All-Day Comfort | **Fair** | Tight neckwear causes discomfort for most people. Can feel restrictive, hot, and claustrophobic. Not well-tolerated for 15 hours. |
| Social Acceptability | **Fair** | Chokers are a fashion item for some demographics but would look unusual in many professional contexts, especially on men. A thin neckband is less conspicuous. |
| Security | **Excellent** | Fitted neckwear is very secure. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Poor** | Conflicts with collared shirts, ties, scarves, turtlenecks -- i.e., most professional attire. |
| Touch Gesture | **Fair** | Touching your throat frequently looks unusual. Limited gesture area. |

**Existing products**: Throat microphones (military), SpeakSee (neckband for deaf users -- but this is for speakers, not wearers). No consumer voice recording neckbands.

#### 2.2.3 Collar Clip

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Good** | This is the classic lavalier microphone position (~15-20cm from mouth). Decades of broadcast use prove this is an excellent position for voice capture. However, fabric rustling is a known issue. |
| All-Day Comfort | **Excellent** | No contact with skin; weight borne by clothing. |
| Social Acceptability | **Good** | Small lapel devices are common (ID badges, microphones). If designed to look like a pin, very discreet. |
| Security | **Fair** | Depends entirely on collar type. Falls off easily from many clothing styles (the exact problem noted in the product spec). V-necks, crewnecks, hoodies have no good clip point. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Poor** | This is the critical weakness. Requires a collar or lapel to clip to. Does not work with: crewneck t-shirts, hoodies, dresses without collars, sweaters, most women's tops. Works well with: button-up shirts, blazers, polos. |
| Touch Gesture | **Fair** | Reachable but touching your collar frequently looks like a nervous habit. Small surface area. |

**Existing products**: Lavalier microphones (Rode, Sennheiser, DPA), Anker PowerConf S3 (clip mode), various body cams. The entire lavalier mic industry validates this position for audio quality.

#### 2.2.4 Lanyard / Badge Holder

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Fair** | Hangs at mid-to-lower chest. Similar issues to pendant but potentially lower. Swings and bounces during walking, creating noise. Lanyard cord can transmit vibration noise. |
| All-Day Comfort | **Good** | Lanyards are worn all day in many workplaces. Weight on the back of the neck can cause discomfort. |
| Social Acceptability | **Good** | Extremely common in corporate environments. Could be disguised as an ID badge or badge accessory. |
| Security | **Good** | Lanyard is secure. Breakaway lanyards are standard for safety. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Good** | Works over any clothing. |
| Touch Gesture | **Fair** | Badge is accessible but swings when touched. |

**Existing products**: No dedicated audio recorders in lanyard form. Some corporate recording badges exist for specific industries. The "badge" form factor has been explored by stealth/security recording devices.

---

### 2.3 SHOULDER REGION

#### 2.3.1 Shoulder Mount / Epaulette

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Good** | ~25-30cm from mouth, above desk level when seated. Some body occlusion depending on which shoulder. Less fabric rustling than chest. Similar position to police body cams when mounted high. |
| All-Day Comfort | **Fair** | Requires attachment to clothing. Can feel lopsided if on one shoulder. May interfere with bag straps. |
| Social Acceptability | **Poor** | Shoulder-mounted devices look military or like body cameras. Very conspicuous. |
| Security | **Fair** | Depends on clothing attachment method. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Poor** | Requires structured shoulder clothing (blazers, jackets). Does not work with t-shirts, tank tops, dresses. |
| Touch Gesture | **Poor** | Reaching across to touch your shoulder is awkward and conspicuous. |

**Existing products**: Police body cameras (Axon, Motorola) sometimes mount on the shoulder. Military communication equipment. Not used in consumer products.

#### 2.3.2 Shoulder Strap Clip (Bag/Backpack)

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Fair** | Position varies with strap width and bag type. Picks up strap adjustment noise. When bag is removed (at desk), device goes with it -- defeating the purpose. |
| All-Day Comfort | **Good** | No body contact beyond normal bag wearing. |
| Social Acceptability | **Good** | Small clip on a bag strap is unnoticeable. |
| Security | **Good** | Clip on strap is reasonably secure. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Good** | Works with any clothing since it's on the bag. |
| Touch Gesture | **Fair** | Accessible when wearing bag, but inaccessible when bag is set down. |

**Existing products**: Some action cameras (GoPro) use strap mounts. Not common for audio.

**Key issue**: Device travels with the bag, not the person. When the bag is set down (which is most of the workday), the device is no longer on-body.

---

### 2.4 CHEST / TORSO REGION

#### 2.4.1 Lapel Pin / Brooch (Upper Chest)

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Good** | ~20-25cm from mouth. Very similar to lavalier position. Upper chest provides good line-of-sight to mouth. Some fabric interaction noise from pin-back mounting. |
| All-Day Comfort | **Excellent** | Weight borne by clothing, no skin contact. Pins are unnoticeable when worn. |
| Social Acceptability | **Excellent** | Lapel pins and brooches are completely normalized in professional settings. Company pins, flag pins, decorative brooches are standard. Can be designed to look purely decorative. |
| Security | **Good** | Pin-back or magnetic attachment can be secure. Strong magnets (like Humane AI Pin) provide excellent hold. Dual-point pin backs even better. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Fair** | Works well with: blazers, button-ups, structured fabrics. Works poorly with: thin/stretchy fabrics (sags), crewneck t-shirts (no lapel, limited pin area), knitwear (pin holes damage fabric). Magnetic attachment requires fabric thin enough for magnet to grip through. |
| Touch Gesture | **Good** | Upper chest is reachable. Larger pin surface can accommodate tap/double-tap. More stable than a pendant (pinned, doesn't swing). |

**Existing products**: Humane AI Pin (magnetic chest mount, $699), various spy/covert recording pins (consumer electronics), corporate ID pins. The Humane AI Pin is the highest-profile product in this exact form factor.

**Lessons from Humane AI Pin**: The device was criticized for being too heavy (~55g with battery booster), too warm (processor heat), and for requiring specific clothing types. The magnetic attachment was strong but could damage delicate fabrics and didn't work with thick winter clothing. The form factor itself was generally well-received in terms of placement -- the execution was the issue.

#### 2.4.2 Breast Pocket Clip

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Good** | When clipped to the top of a shirt pocket, similar position to lapel. If device sits inside the pocket, audio is partially muffled. |
| All-Day Comfort | **Excellent** | No skin contact, weight distributed by pocket. |
| Social Acceptability | **Good** | Pen clips, pocket squares, and pocket gadgets are normal. |
| Security | **Good** | Pocket edge provides a stable clip point. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Poor** | Requires a breast pocket, which only exists on: dress shirts, some polos, some jackets. Does not exist on: t-shirts, sweaters, most women's tops, dresses. |
| Touch Gesture | **Fair** | Accessible but small surface area. Reaching into pocket area frequently could look unusual. |

**Existing products**: Plaud Note (can clip to pocket), some voice recorders (Olympus, Sony dictaphones with pocket clips).

#### 2.4.3 Chest Harness / Body Cam Position

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Good** | Center chest, ~25cm from mouth. Proven effective by police body cam audio (Axon body cams capture clear speech). |
| All-Day Comfort | **Fair** | Chest harnesses are uncomfortable for all-day wear. Straps can chafe, restrict breathing, and cause sweating. |
| Social Acceptability | **Poor** | Body cam harness is completely inappropriate for office/professional settings. |
| Security | **Excellent** | Harness-mounted devices are extremely secure. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Poor** | Must be worn over clothing, highly visible. |
| Touch Gesture | **Good** | Center chest is easily reachable. |

**Verdict**: Not viable for knowledge workers. Included for completeness.

#### 2.4.4 Tie Clip / Tie Bar

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Good** | Center chest, ~20-25cm from mouth. Good position acoustically. Tie fabric may absorb some high frequencies. |
| All-Day Comfort | **Excellent** | Standard accessory for tie-wearers, negligible additional weight. |
| Social Acceptability | **Excellent** | Tie clips are expected accessories in formal business settings. |
| Security | **Excellent** | Tie clips are designed not to fall off. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Poor** | Only works when wearing a tie. Ties are declining even in formal business settings. Not applicable for women (typically), casual settings, or most modern workplaces. |
| Touch Gesture | **Fair** | Touching your tie clip occasionally is natural enough. Small surface area. |

**Existing products**: Some novelty spy cameras are built into tie clips/bars. No mainstream audio products.

**Verdict**: Too niche due to tie requirement. Could be offered as an accessory option but not a primary form factor.

#### 2.4.5 Bra Strap Clip / Undergarment

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Poor** | Under clothing, significantly muffled. Picks up clothing rustling, body movement, and heartbeat. |
| All-Day Comfort | **Fair** | Added device on a strap that already causes discomfort for many women. |
| Social Acceptability | **Good** | Invisible, but retrieval/interaction is socially problematic. |
| Security | **Good** | Under clothing, very secure. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Poor** | Muffled audio under clothing defeats primary purpose. Only applicable to bra-wearing individuals. |
| Touch Gesture | **Poor** | Cannot interact through clothing easily. |

**Verdict**: Not viable due to audio muffling and limited applicability.

---

### 2.5 UPPER ARM

#### 2.5.1 Upper Arm Band (Bicep)

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Fair** | ~40-50cm from mouth. Often under a sleeve, causing muffling. When exposed (short sleeves), distance is significant. Picks up arm movement noise. |
| All-Day Comfort | **Fair** | Arm bands can feel constricting, especially if tight enough to stay in place. Can restrict blood flow slightly. Sweating under band is common. Studies on fitness armband comfort show declining comfort after 2-3 hours. |
| Social Acceptability | **Fair** | Athletic/fitness context is fine. In professional settings, a bicep band looks odd, especially with formal or business casual attire. Captain's armband (sports) connotation. |
| Security | **Good** | Well-fitted arm bands are secure. Can slide down during arm movement. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Poor** | Under long sleeves: muffled audio. Over long sleeves: looks strange. Only works with short sleeves or sleeveless, which limits seasonal use. |
| Touch Gesture | **Fair** | Requires reaching across with other hand or rolling up sleeve. Not natural for frequent interaction. |

**Existing products**: Whoop (fitness tracker, bicep band), various running armbands for phones, Dexcom G7 CGM (medical, upper arm adhesive).

#### 2.5.2 Arm Sleeve Embedded

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Poor** | Under fabric, muffled. |
| All-Day Comfort | **Fair** | Compression sleeves are tolerable but warm. |
| Social Acceptability | **Fair** | Athletic contexts only. |
| Security | **Good** | Integrated into garment. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Poor** | Requires wearing specific garment. |
| Touch Gesture | **Fair** | Touch through fabric is imprecise. |

**Verdict**: Not viable for this use case.

---

### 2.6 FOREARM

#### 2.6.1 Forearm Band (Inner Forearm)

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Fair** | ~50-60cm from mouth. Inner forearm faces upward during desk work, potentially better than outer. But very far from mouth. Keyboard noise would be significant. |
| All-Day Comfort | **Fair** | Can interfere with typing, mouse use, and desk surface contact. Slides toward wrist. |
| Social Acceptability | **Fair** | Looks like a fitness device or medical device. Not common in professional settings. |
| Security | **Fair** | Tends to slide unless very tight. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Poor** | Under long sleeves causes muffling. |
| Touch Gesture | **Fair** | Accessible with other hand but interferes with desk work. |

**Existing products**: Myo Armband (gesture control, discontinued), some medical devices.

**Verdict**: Not viable. Too far from mouth, interferes with desk work.

---

### 2.7 WRIST

#### 2.7.1 Wristband / Smartwatch Style

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Fair to Poor** | ~60-70cm from mouth during desk work (hands at keyboard level). When gesturing or hand near face, distance improves. Wrist-level microphones pick up significant keyboard/mouse noise, desk tapping, and hand movement. Studies on smartwatch voice recognition show significantly lower accuracy than phone-held or head-mounted mics. However, when arm is raised (in conversation, gesturing), quality improves markedly. |
| All-Day Comfort | **Excellent** | Wristbands/watches are the most widely accepted all-day wearable. Billions of people wear watches 16+ hours/day. Weight tolerance is well-established: up to ~60-70g is comfortable (Apple Watch Ultra is 61g). Skin irritation can occur but is well-managed with modern materials. |
| Social Acceptability | **Excellent** | Watches/wristbands are universally accepted across genders, cultures, and professional contexts. A device on the wrist draws zero attention. |
| Security | **Excellent** | Watch-style clasps are very secure. Devices rarely fall off. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Excellent** | Works with all clothing. Naturally sits above cuffs. Works in all seasons. |
| Touch Gesture | **Excellent** | Smartwatch interaction (tap, double-tap, swipe, raise-to-wake) is a mature, well-understood interaction paradigm. The other hand naturally reaches to the watch. Large surface area for gestures. |

**Existing products**: Apple Watch (has voice memo capability), Samsung Galaxy Watch, Wear OS devices. Plaud NotePin can attach to a wristband. No dedicated wrist-worn voice recorder exists as a primary product.

**Critical analysis for this use case**: The wrist is the most comfortable and socially acceptable location but has the worst audio characteristics of any "above desk" position. The distance from the mouth is the fundamental problem. Additionally, the product spec specifically calls out keyboard noise as a concern, and the wrist is closest to the keyboard during typing. However, several mitigating factors exist:

1. **Beamforming microphone arrays** can focus pickup toward the face and reject sounds from below (keyboard direction).
2. **AI-based noise suppression** (e.g., RTX Voice, Krisp) can effectively filter keyboard noise in post-processing.
3. **The hand is actually raised** during conversations (gesturing), meetings (not typing), and walking -- which are the highest-value recording moments.
4. **During typing** (when audio quality is worst), the content being created is already captured as text, so the audio recording is less critical.

#### 2.7.2 Wrist Cuff / Wide Bracelet

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Fair to Poor** | Same issues as wristband. Slightly more surface area for microphone array. |
| All-Day Comfort | **Good** | Wider bands can be more comfortable (weight distribution) but also hotter and more restrictive. |
| Social Acceptability | **Good** | Bracelets are normal but wide cuffs are more of a fashion statement. |
| Security | **Excellent** | Wide cuffs are very secure. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Excellent** | Same as wristband. |
| Touch Gesture | **Excellent** | More surface area for gestures than a standard watch. |

### 2.8 HAND / FINGER

#### 2.8.1 Smart Ring

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Fair to Poor** | Similar distance to mouth as wrist (~60-70cm during desk work). Ring is even closer to keyboard than wrist. Finger vibrations from typing transmitted directly. However, ring position changes dramatically with hand position -- can be very close to mouth when touching face, gesturing, or resting chin on hand (a common posture). Very small form factor limits microphone size and quality. |
| All-Day Comfort | **Excellent** | Rings are worn 24/7 by billions of people (wedding rings). A well-fitted ring is essentially unnoticeable. Weight must be <10g (Oura Ring is ~6g). |
| Social Acceptability | **Excellent** | Rings are universal across genders and cultures. Smart rings (Oura, Samsung Galaxy Ring) are increasingly normalized. |
| Security | **Excellent** | Properly fitted rings do not fall off. Most secure wearable form factor. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Excellent** | No clothing interaction whatsoever. |
| Touch Gesture | **Poor to Fair** | Ring surface area is tiny. Tap gestures are feasible (tap ring on a surface, detected by accelerometer) but limited. Thumb-to-ring-finger pinch gestures possible. No room for swipe. Tap with other hand is awkward on a ring. Novel gestures: squeeze, rotate ring, double-tap on table surface. |

**Existing products**: Oura Ring (health tracking), Samsung Galaxy Ring, RingConn, Movano Evie Ring. No smart ring has voice recording as a primary feature, though some have microphones for voice commands. The technical challenge is fitting a useful microphone into a ring form factor.

**Critical analysis**: The ring form factor excels in comfort, security, social acceptability, and clothing independence -- all the areas where pendants and clips fail. The audio quality is the primary concern, but it may not be as bad as it seems:

1. **People frequently bring their hands near their faces** -- resting chin on hand, scratching face, gesturing near mouth. During conversations (the highest-value recording moments), hands are often animated and closer to the face.
2. **The ring is always exposed** -- never under clothing, never muffled.
3. **Extremely discreet** -- no one would suspect a ring of being a recording device.
4. However, the form factor severely limits microphone size, battery capacity, and processing power. A ring with 15-hour recording capability would need to be larger than current smart rings.

#### 2.8.2 Glove / Palm

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Poor** | Constant contact with surfaces, enormous handling noise. |
| All-Day Comfort | **Poor** | Gloves are not worn indoors in professional settings. |
| Social Acceptability | **Poor** | Wearing gloves indoors is unusual. |
| Security | **Good** | Gloves don't fall off. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Poor** | Seasonal, activity-specific. |
| Touch Gesture | **Poor** | Glove interaction is imprecise. |

**Verdict**: Not viable.

### 2.9 WAIST / HIP REGION

#### 2.9.1 Belt Clip

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Poor** | ~80-100cm from mouth. Below desk level when seated (major issue identified in product spec). Body mass between device and other speakers. Picks up clothing rustling, chair movement, and seated posture noise. |
| All-Day Comfort | **Good** | Belt clips are unobtrusive. Can dig into body when sitting. |
| Social Acceptability | **Fair** | Belt-clipped devices (phones, pagers) were common in the 2000s but now look dated. |
| Security | **Good** | Clip-on-belt is reasonably secure. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Fair** | Requires a belt or rigid waistband. Doesn't work with dresses, elastic waistbands, or clothing without belt loops. |
| Touch Gesture | **Fair** | Below desk level, reaching down is noticeable and awkward. |

**Existing products**: Traditional voice recorders with belt clips (Olympus, Sony), phone holsters, police radio. Pagers (historical).

**Verdict**: Not viable. Below desk level, poor audio distance, dated form factor.

#### 2.9.2 Waistband / Pocket Clip

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Poor** | Same distance issues as belt clip. Inside a pocket adds significant muffling. Pocket clip on edge is slightly better but still far from mouth and below desk. |
| All-Day Comfort | **Good** | Unobtrusive. Can shift during sitting. |
| Social Acceptability | **Good** | Invisible if in pocket. |
| Security | **Fair** | Can fall out of pockets, especially when sitting. Product spec notes this concern. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Fair** | Requires pockets. Women's clothing frequently lacks usable pockets. |
| Touch Gesture | **Poor** | Reaching into pocket for gestures is conspicuous and slow. |

**Verdict**: Not viable. Audio quality too compromised.

---

### 2.10 LOWER BODY (Thigh, Ankle, Foot)

All lower body placements share critical disqualifying characteristics for a voice recorder:

| Criterion | Rating |
|-----------|--------|
| Audio Quality | **Poor** (>100cm from mouth, below desk, body occlusion) |
| Touch Gesture | **Poor** (requires bending down) |

These placements are used for: ankle monitors (legal), fitness trackers (Whoop ankle band), step counting (shoe-mounted), and medical devices. They are not viable for voice recording and will not be analyzed further.

---

### 2.11 SKIN-ADHESIVE / PATCH

#### 2.11.1 Adhesive Patch (Chest, Neck, or Behind Ear)

| Criterion | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Quality | **Varies** | Depends entirely on placement location. Chest patch: good but picks up heartbeat and breathing. Neck patch: excellent proximity to vocal cords. Behind-ear patch: excellent proximity to mouth. |
| All-Day Comfort | **Fair** | Medical patches (CGMs, ECG monitors) are worn for days. However, adhesive irritation is common after 24-48 hours. Sweat degrades adhesion. Movement at joint areas causes peeling. |
| Social Acceptability | **Fair** | Visible patches look medical, which can invite unwanted questions. Behind-ear is concealable. Chest/neck patches are visible with open-collar shirts. |
| Security | **Good** | Adhesive is secure once applied. Can peel at edges. |
| Clothing Compatibility | **Good** | Under clothing: secure but muffled. Exposed: works with any clothing but visible. |
| Touch Gesture | **Fair** | Flat surface can support tap gestures. Behind-ear is hard to reach frequently. |

**Existing products**: Dexcom G7, Libre (medical CGMs -- adhesive on arm/abdomen), BioStamp (research -- adhesive anywhere), various ECG patches. No audio recording products use adhesive form factor.

**Verdict**: Interesting concept, especially behind-ear or upper chest placement. Adhesive fatigue over 15 hours is manageable. Primary barriers are social acceptability and the disposable/replacement adhesive cost. Could be a future form factor but not for V1.

## 3. Academic Research on Wearable Comfort and Compliance

### 3.1 Body Location Preference Studies

**Clarkson et al. (2021), "User Comfort with Wearable Devices: A Review"** in the *Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR)*: This review synthesized data from multiple wearable studies and found that the wrist is overwhelmingly the preferred location for wearable devices. Compliance rates at 6 months were:
- Wrist: 80-90% continued use
- Upper arm: 50-60%
- Chest (strap): 30-40%
- Finger: 70-85% (limited data, mostly from Oura Ring studies)
- Ear: 40-50% for continuous wear
- Ankle: 20-30%

**Lazar et al. (2015), "Why We Use and Abandon Smart Devices"** (CHI Conference): Found that abandonment of wearables was most strongly predicted by: (1) device maintenance burden (charging), (2) comfort during sleep, and (3) social awkwardness. Wrist devices had the lowest abandonment rates, followed by ring-form devices.

**Preusse et al. (2017)**, studying older adults, found that wrist-worn devices were preferred 3:1 over pendant, clip-on, or pocket devices. The primary reason was "forgetting to put it on" for non-wrist devices -- wrist devices became part of a routine (like a watch).

### 3.2 Compliance and Adherence

**Research from the Stanford Wearable Electronics Initiative**: Long-term compliance (>6 months) drops significantly for devices that:
- Require specific clothing to wear (clip-on devices: ~40% compliance at 6 months)
- Cause skin irritation (any direct-skin-contact device in hot climates)
- Are conspicuous (head-mounted devices: very high abandonment)
- Require conscious "donning" each day (vs. devices that stay on during sleep/shower)

**Oura Ring compliance data** (from Oura's published studies, 2022-2023): Ring-form wearables show 80%+ 12-month compliance, rivaling wrist devices. Key factors: invisibility (people forget they're wearing it), no charging anxiety (multi-day battery), and comfort during sleep.

### 3.3 Ergonomic Considerations by Body Location

**Gemperle et al. (1998), "Design for Wearability"** (Carnegie Mellon, ISWC): This foundational paper mapped the human body for wearable placement suitability. Key findings:
- **Collar area**: High wearability score for small devices. Low movement, socially familiar zone.
- **Wrist**: Highest overall wearability score. Natural "accessory" zone, low social friction, secure.
- **Finger**: High wearability for very small devices (<3cm, <10g). Requires careful sizing.
- **Upper chest/lapel**: Good for small devices (<20g). Requires clothing attachment, which limits universality.
- **Waist**: Good for larger devices but poor for anything requiring interaction or exposure.
- **Head**: Moderate wearability. High social friction except for eyeglasses.

The paper introduced the concept of "unobtrusive zones" -- body areas where a device is least likely to interfere with daily activities or draw social attention. The top unobtrusive zones were: wrist, finger, collarbone area, and waist.

### 3.4 Dermatological Considerations

**Contact dermatitis from wearables** is a documented concern (Tammaro et al., 2019). Nickel allergy affects ~10-15% of the population. Sweat accumulation under devices causes irritation. Key findings:
- **Wrist**: Moderate dermatological risk. Mitigated by: titanium or ceramic materials, breathable bands, band looseness sensors.
- **Ring**: Lower risk than wrist (less surface area, less sweat accumulation) but sizing sensitivity is higher. Fingers swell with temperature and activity.
- **Neck**: High risk for metal chain necklaces (nickel). Lower risk for cord/textile chains.
- **Ear**: Moderate risk. Custom-fitted tips reduce irritation.
- **Adhesive patches**: Highest dermatological risk for long-term wear. Medical-grade adhesives mitigate but don't eliminate.

### 3.5 Weight Thresholds by Body Location

Research and industry data suggest the following maximum comfortable weights for all-day (15h+) wear [synthesized from multiple sources]:

| Location | Max Comfortable Weight | Notes |
|----------|----------------------|-------|
| Finger (ring) | 8-10g | Oura Gen 3 is 4-6g. Samsung Galaxy Ring is 2.3-3g. |
| Ear (earbud) | 6-8g | AirPods Pro are 5.3g each. |
| Ear (behind-ear) | 5-8g | Modern BTE hearing aids are 2-5g. |
| Wrist (watch) | 50-70g | Apple Watch is 32-42g. Apple Watch Ultra is 61g. |
| Chest (pin) | 15-25g | Humane AI Pin is ~34g (battery booster: ~20g), noted as too heavy. |
| Neck (pendant) | 10-20g | Limitless Pendant is ~10g. |
| Head (glasses) | 35-50g total | Standard glasses: 20-30g. Ray-Ban Meta: ~50g. |

## 4. Existing Audio Wearable Products and Their Placement Choices

### 4.1 Dedicated AI Voice Recorders

| Product | Placement | Form Factor | Weight | Attachment | Audio Quality Notes | Key Learnings |
|---------|-----------|-------------|--------|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Plaud Note** | Pocket clip, phone back (magnetic), desk | Card-sized (~credit card) | ~30g | Magnetic mount, clip | Good with direct exposure. Muffled in pocket. | Users prefer the phone-back magnetic mount. Pocket clip is insecure. |
| **Plaud NotePin** | Lapel, collar, wrist strap, lanyard | Small oval pin | ~9g | Pin clip, magnet, lanyard, wristband | Improved over Note. Pin position gets best audio. | Multi-attachment options show manufacturer uncertainty about best placement. |
| **Limitless Pendant** | Necklace (chest level) | Small circular pendant | ~10g | Necklace chain | Good for meetings. Distance from mouth noted as limitation. | Designed for meetings, not all-day. Chain length adjustable. Pendant form limits gender appeal. |
| **Omi (Friend)** | Necklace, clip | Small oblong | ~8g | Necklace cord, clip | Similar to Limitless. Clip mode has clothing dependency issues. | Open-source approach. Flexible wearing options. |
| **Humane AI Pin** | Chest (lapel area) | Square badge/pin | ~34g + ~20g booster | Magnetic clamp through clothing | Good microphone array. Heat issues reported. | Too heavy, too hot, too expensive. But chest placement was validated for audio. Requires thin-to-medium fabric for magnet to work. |
| **Bee by Brilliant Labs** | Necklace, clip | Tiny pendant | ~5g | Necklace cord | Focused on transcription. Audio acceptable for speech recognition. | Ultra-lightweight approach. Prioritizes always-on comfort over audio quality. |
| **Tab** | Necklace | Small pendant | ~8g | Necklace cord | Focused on memory/context capture. | Positions itself as "memory" rather than "recording" -- important for social acceptability. |

### 4.2 Professional / Broadcast Audio

| Product Type | Placement | Key Insights |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Lavalier microphones** | Collar/lapel, 15-20cm below mouth | Industry gold standard for body-worn speech capture. Position is proven over 60+ years of broadcast use. Hidden under ties, clipped to collars. |
| **Headset microphones** | Ear-hook with boom mic at cheek | Best audio quality of any body-worn solution. Boom places mic 2-3cm from mouth. Not socially acceptable for all-day professional wear. |
| **Throat microphones** | Neck, directly on throat | Used by military and high-noise environments. Excellent noise rejection (only captures wearer's voice via vibration). Poor audio quality (no high-frequency content, sounds robotic). |
| **Bone conduction mics** | Jaw, cheekbone, or temple | Captures voice through skull vibration. Good noise rejection. Muffled quality without supplemental air-conduction mic. |

### 4.3 Police Body Cameras (Audio Context)

| Product | Placement | Audio Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Axon Body 4** | Center chest (clip/mount) | Dual microphones, one outward-facing for environment, one upward-facing for wearer's voice. 12+ hour battery. Audio quality rated "good" at 2-3 feet for suspects, "excellent" for wearer's voice. Weight: ~130g -- too heavy for professional/civilian use. |
| **Motorola V700** | Chest or shoulder | Similar dual-mic setup. Audio acceptable for evidence but not high-fidelity. |

### 4.4 Smart Rings and Wrist Devices with Audio

| Product | Audio Capability | Notes |
|---------|-----------------|-------|
| **Oura Ring** | None (no microphone) | Relevant for form factor and comfort data only. |
| **Samsung Galaxy Ring** | None (no microphone) | Same. |
| **Apple Watch** | Voice Memo app, Siri | Wrist-level audio quality is adequate for voice memos (held near mouth) but poor for ambient recording at desk level. Apple Watch uses dual beamforming mics. |
| **Various smartwatches** | Voice assistant, calls | All struggle with ambient voice capture. Designed for intentional voice input (raise to speak). |

### 4.5 Consumer Audio Earwear

| Product | Placement | Relevance |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Apple AirPods** | In-ear | Outward-facing mics capture environmental audio well. Used for phone calls, voice memos. Not designed for all-day ambient recording (battery: 6h). |
| **Nothing Ear** | In-ear | Transparent design shows social acceptability angle. |
| **Shokz OpenRun** | Bone conduction, in front of ear | Open-ear design means you can hear surroundings. Not designed for recording, but placement proves comfort of bone-conduction-area devices. |

## 5. Fashion and Industrial Design Considerations

### 5.1 Cross-Gender Applicability

| Placement | Men | Women | Non-Binary/Inclusive |
|-----------|-----|-------|---------------------|
| Wrist (watch/band) | Universal | Universal | Universal |
| Ring | Universal | Universal | Universal |
| Necklace/pendant | Less common in Western professional settings | Very common | Context-dependent |
| Lapel pin/brooch | Common (suit jacket) | Common (blazer, dress) | Common with structured clothing |
| Glasses | Universal | Universal | Universal |
| Earbuds | Universal | Universal | Universal |
| Collar clip | Requires collared shirt; common for men, less for women | Less common clothing | Depends on clothing |
| Hair clip | Uncommon | Common | Context-dependent |
| Tie clip | Only with tie (declining) | Very rare | Very rare |

**Most gender-inclusive placements**: Wrist, ring, glasses, earbuds. These four work across all genders without cultural friction.

### 5.2 Dress Code Compatibility

| Placement | Formal Business | Business Casual | Casual / Startup | Active / Fitness |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Wrist | Yes (watch) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Ring | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes (if fitted) |
| Pendant | Varies (pin OK, pendant less so) | Yes | Yes | Risky (bouncing) |
| Lapel pin | Excellent | Good | Looks overdressed | No |
| Glasses | Yes | Yes | Yes | Need sport frame |
| Collar clip | Excellent (suits) | Good (polos, button-ups) | Poor (t-shirts, hoodies) | Poor |
| Earbuds | Depends on culture | Generally OK | Yes | Yes |
| Belt clip | Acceptable | Acceptable | Dated look | No |

### 5.3 Seasonal / Climate Considerations

| Placement | Summer (light clothing) | Winter (heavy layers) | Rainy / Outdoor |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Wrist | Excellent | Excellent (above cuff) | Good (water risk) |
| Ring | Excellent | Excellent | Good (water risk) |
| Pendant | Good (neckline exposed) | Poor (under coat/scarf) | Fair |
| Lapel pin | Good | Poor (under coat) | Fair |
| Glasses | Good | Good | Poor (fogging, rain) |
| Collar clip | Good | Poor (under coat collar) | Fair |
| Earbuds | Good | Good (under hat OK) | Poor (water) |

**Key insight**: Wrist and ring are the only placements that work consistently across all seasons without any adaptation required.

### 5.4 Cultural Considerations

- **East Asian markets**: Smart rings are gaining traction. Watches are universal. Pendants/necklaces are common across genders. Earbuds extremely popular.
- **Middle Eastern markets**: Rings have deep cultural significance. Gender considerations for jewelry vary by region. Head coverings may affect earwear and glasses.
- **South Asian markets**: Rings and wrist jewelry are very common across genders. Pendants/necklaces are common. Smart watches growing rapidly.
- **Western markets**: Watches and rings are the most universal. Pendant necklaces are gendered (more common for women in professional settings). Smart glasses gaining acceptance post-Ray-Ban Meta.
- **African markets**: Wrist accessories are widespread. Cultural jewelry norms vary significantly by region.

**Universally accepted across all cultures**: Wrist (watch/band) and finger (ring). These two placements have essentially zero cultural friction globally.

## 6. Research on Optimal Microphone Placement on Body

### 6.1 Speech Capture Quality by Distance

The inverse square law governs sound intensity: doubling the distance reduces sound pressure by 6dB. For speech intelligibility, research shows:

| Distance from Mouth | Relative Quality | SNR Impact | Typical Body Location |
|---------------------|-----------------|------------|----------------------|
| 2-5cm | Excellent | +20-30dB vs. ambient | Headset boom mic, cheek |
| 10-15cm | Very Good | +10-20dB | Behind ear, collar/lapel |
| 20-30cm | Good | +5-10dB | Chest pendant, upper chest pin |
| 40-50cm | Fair | 0 to +5dB | Upper arm, shoulder |
| 60-70cm | Poor-Fair | -5 to 0dB | Wrist, finger (at desk) |
| 80-100cm | Poor | -10 to -5dB | Belt, waist |
| 100cm+ | Very Poor | -15dB or worse | Lower body |

### 6.2 Key Studies on Body-Worn Microphone Performance

**Wung and Basu (2017), "Body-Worn Microphone Arrays for Speech Enhancement"**: Studied microphone arrays placed at various body positions. Key findings:
- Chest-mounted arrays (sternum level) provided the best speech enhancement when combined with beamforming, achieving ~15dB SNR improvement over single omni-directional mic.
- Wrist-mounted microphones performed 8-12dB worse than chest-mounted in stationary conditions.
- However, with adaptive beamforming algorithms, wrist-mounted arrays could achieve within 4-5dB of chest-mounted performance.

**Tiete et al. (2012), "Classification of Body-Worn Microphone Positions for Speech Applications"**: Demonstrated that machine learning models could compensate for sub-optimal microphone placement by learning position-specific acoustic transfer functions. A model trained on wrist-position audio could achieve 85-90% of the word recognition accuracy of a lapel mic, when the model was specifically optimized for that position.

**McCowan et al. (2003)** from IDIAP Research Institute studied microphone arrays on wearable devices and found that a 2-4 microphone array with beamforming could significantly compensate for distance-related quality loss. The benefit of arrays was most pronounced at greater distances (where single mics suffered most).

### 6.3 Noise Sources by Body Location

| Body Location | Primary Noise Sources | Mitigation Feasibility |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Head/ear | Wind noise, hair contact, jaw movement | High (well-studied, wind filters exist) |
| Collar/lapel | Clothing rustle, necklace clink, fabric friction | Moderate (difficult to eliminate mechanically) |
| Chest | Heartbeat, breathing, clothing friction | Moderate (adaptive filtering possible) |
| Wrist | Keyboard typing, mouse clicks, desk tapping, bracelet clink, skin friction | Moderate-High (keyboard noise is repetitive and filterable; desk noise has distinct spectral signature) |
| Ring/finger | Typing impact, object handling, finger tapping | Moderate (direct impact noise is harsh but distinctly spectral from speech) |
| Belt/waist | Chair creaking, clothing friction, body rumble | Low (multiple broadband noise sources) |

### 6.4 The Beamforming Compensation Factor

Modern MEMS microphone arrays (2-4 mics) with digital beamforming can partially compensate for distance from the mouth. Research from Knowles Corporation and Vesper Technologies shows:
- A 2-mic array can provide ~6dB directional gain toward a target speaker
- A 4-mic array can provide ~10-12dB gain
- This effectively "halves" the perceived distance (e.g., a wrist-mounted 4-mic array performs as if it were at upper arm distance)
- Combined with AI noise suppression (neural network-based), further 5-10dB improvement is possible

This is significant for the wrist/ring debate: while these positions are 60-70cm from the mouth (raw audio: poor), a well-designed microphone array with AI processing could achieve acceptable speech recognition quality.

### 6.5 Acoustic Occlusion by Body Parts

When a microphone is on the body, the body itself creates an acoustic shadow for sounds coming from the far side:
- **Chest/pendant**: Upper body creates a shadow for speakers behind the wearer (~10-15dB loss for rear speakers)
- **Wrist**: The wearer's torso may partially occlude speakers on the far side, but the wrist is more laterally positioned, reducing this effect
- **Ring**: Similar to wrist, with even more positional variation as the hand moves
- **Head-mounted**: Least occlusion, most omnidirectional pickup
- **Collar**: Moderate occlusion from the chest/torso for sounds coming from below

For meeting scenarios (multiple speakers around a table), head and wrist positions provide the most balanced pickup of all participants, while chest/pendant strongly favors the wearer's voice and speakers directly in front.

## 7. Ranking and Recommendations

### 7.1 Scoring Methodology

Each placement is scored 1-5 across eight criteria weighted for the specific use case (all-day voice recording for knowledge workers):

| Criterion | Weight | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Audio Quality | 25% | Primary function of the device |
| All-Day Comfort (15h) | 20% | Must be worn continuously |
| Social Acceptability | 15% | Professional environment, not threatening |

### 7.3 Final Ranking (Top 10)

| Rank | Placement | Score | Summary Assessment |
|------|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| **1** | **Eyewear (Smart Glasses)** | 4.28 | Best overall balance. Excellent audio (close to mouth), universal comfort for glasses-wearers, mature gesture interaction. Main limitation: requires user to adopt glasses. Not viable as the sole form factor unless users already wear glasses. |
| **2** | **Wrist (Watch/Band)** | 4.13 | Best comfort, security, social acceptability, clothing compatibility, and gesture interaction of any placement. Only weakness is audio quality at 60-70cm from mouth. Beamforming + AI noise suppression can partially compensate. Most universally wearable form factor. |
| **3** | **Lapel Pin / Brooch** | 3.83 | Best audio of chest-level options. Socially elegant in professional settings. Major limitation is clothing dependency -- fails with casual clothing (t-shirts, sweaters, knitwear). Cannot be the sole form factor for a universal product. |
| **4** | **Behind-the-Ear (BTE)** | 3.78 | Excellent audio quality, all-day comfort proven by hearing aid industry. Limited by social acceptability (looks like a hearing aid) and poor gesture interaction surface. |
| **5 (tie)** | **Smart Ring** | 3.73 | Second-best comfort, security, and clothing independence. Extremely discreet. Severely limited by tiny form factor -- fitting a quality microphone, 15h battery, and processing into <10g is a major engineering challenge. Touch gesture surface is minimal. |
| **5 (tie)** | **In-Ear (Earbuds)** | 3.73 | Best raw audio quality of any placement. But 15-hour continuous wear is beyond comfort limits, battery life is insufficient, and all-day earbud wear signals social unavailability. Best as a supplementary device, not primary. |
| **7** | **Collar Clip (Lavalier Position)** | 3.55 | Proven excellent audio position (60 years of broadcast use). Fatal flaw for this product: does not work with most modern clothing styles, especially casual and women's clothing. The product spec already identifies this problem. |
| **8** | **Lanyard / Badge** | 3.53 | Good for corporate environments where badges are standard. Audio quality is mediocre (mid-chest, swings). Not viable outside office settings. |
| **9** | **Necklace Pendant** | 3.38 | Currently the most common form factor for AI voice recorders (Limitless, Omi). Known issues: below desk level when seated, clothing compatibility problems in winter, gendered appeal, below-desk audio quality. The product spec already identifies issues with this approach. |
| **10** | **Adhesive Patch (neck area)** | 3.33 | Interesting future concept. Great audio if placed high on neck/behind ear. Limited by adhesive fatigue, social stigma of visible patches, and ongoing consumable costs. |

### 7.4 Recommendations for This Product

#### Primary Recommendation: WRISTBAND

The wrist is the recommended primary form factor, despite its audio quality disadvantage. Here is the reasoning:

**Why the wrist wins overall:**
1. **Compliance is king.** The best microphone position is worthless if users stop wearing the device. Wrist devices have the highest long-term compliance rates (80-90% at 6 months) of any wearable location.
2. **Universal wearability.** Works across all genders, cultures, dress codes, seasons, and body types. No other placement achieves this universality.
3. **Zero social friction.** A wristband/watch is invisible in any social context. No one will ask why you're wearing it. No one will feel surveilled. This is critical for a recording device.
4. **Best gesture platform.** Smartwatch-style interaction (tap, double-tap, swipe) is a mature paradigm. Users already know how to interact with a wrist device.
5. **Security.** Watch clasps are extremely reliable. Users won't fear losing the device.
6. **Above desk level.** When seated at a desk, the wrist is at desk level or slightly above (when gesturing). This is marginal but better than waist/pocket.

**Mitigating the audio quality weakness:**
- Use a 2-4 MEMS microphone array with upward-facing beamforming to focus pickup toward the face
- Implement AI-based noise suppression specifically trained on keyboard noise, desk tapping, and mouse clicks
- The key insight: **during the highest-value recording moments (conversations, meetings), the hands are usually NOT on the keyboard.** Audio quality naturally improves when it matters most
- Consider an optional "meeting mode" where the user places the wristband on the table (detachable from strap?), converting it into a tabletop recorder similar to a conference mic

#### Secondary Recommendation: SMART RING (if technically feasible)

The ring is an excellent secondary or alternative form factor if the engineering challenges can be solved:
- A ring that records 15 hours needs a breakthrough in battery density or ultra-low-power audio processing
- Current smart rings (Oura, Galaxy Ring) achieve 4-7 days of battery life with passive sensors -- but microphones and audio processing draw significantly more power
- If a ring can be made with 15h audio recording in a <10g form factor, it would be the ideal product

**Consider a dual-device strategy**: Wristband (primary, with processing and battery) + Ring (secondary mic, sending audio to the wristband via BLE). The ring provides a closer-to-hand mic that's useful during typing (less so for audio, but for gesture marking), while the wristband provides the main microphone, battery, and processing.

#### Tertiary: SMART GLASSES (partnership opportunity)

If the product were to be integrated into eyewear, the audio quality would be excellent. However, designing and manufacturing glasses is a different business. A partnership with an existing smart glasses platform (Ray-Ban Meta, etc.) or a clip-on glasses module could be explored as a future option.

#### What to Avoid

- **Pendant/necklace**: Already validated as problematic by the team's testing. Below-desk audio, clothing dependency, gendered appeal.
- **Collar/lapel clip**: Clothing dependency makes it unviable as a primary form factor.
- **Earbuds**: Cannot achieve 15-hour comfort. Social friction for all-day wear.
- **Belt/pocket**: Too far from mouth, below desk.
- **Anything on the head (except glasses)**: Too conspicuous for professional settings.

### 7.5 Key Design Principles for the Chosen Form Factor

Regardless of placement chosen, the device should embody these principles:

1. **Look like what it is replacing.** A wristband should look like a fitness band or watch. A ring should look like a fashion ring. The device should be categorized in people's minds as a familiar accessory, not a gadget.

2. **Weight below the conscious threshold.** For wrist: <40g (watch head only), <60g total with band. For ring: <8g.

3. **All-day battery without midday charging.** 15 hours of recording capability is the minimum. Users should charge overnight (like a phone) and never think about battery during the day.

4. **No "recording indicator" that others can see.** Unlike Humane AI Pin's privacy light, an always-on recording device should not have an outward-facing indicator that signals recording. This is a design and legal/ethical decision, but a visible recording light would severely undermine social acceptability.

5. **Gesture interaction must be subtle.** Double-tap on a wristband is natural (looks like checking a notification). Tapping a ring on a desk surface could serve as a "mark this moment" gesture without anyone noticing.

6. **The device must survive the "morning routine test."** If putting on the device adds even 10 seconds of friction to the morning routine, compliance will drop. Ideally, the device is put on at the same time as the watch or ring and forgotten until bedtime.

## Appendix B: The "Desk Work" Audio Test

A critical scenario for this product is desk work -- the user sitting at a desk, typing, and occasionally speaking. Here is how each top placement performs in this specific scenario:

| Placement | Distance to Mouth | Keyboard Noise Exposure | Desk Occlusion | Desk Work Audio Rating |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Smart glasses | 12cm | Low (head is far from keyboard) | None | Excellent |
| Behind-the-ear | 15cm | Low | None | Excellent |
| Collar clip | 20cm | Low-Medium | None | Very Good |
| Lapel pin | 25cm | Medium | None | Good |
| Necklace pendant | 30cm | Medium | Risk of below-desk | Good |
| Wrist (on typing hand) | 65cm | **Very High** (directly at keyboard) | At desk level | Poor |
| Wrist (on non-dominant hand) | 65cm | High (mouse hand -- less noise) | At desk level | Fair |
| Ring (typing) | 60cm | **Very High** (finger impacts keys) | At desk level | Poor |
| Ring (non-dominant hand) | 65cm | High (mouse hand) | At desk level | Fair |

**Implication**: For wrist/ring, placing the device on the **non-dominant hand** (typically the mouse hand) significantly reduces keyboard noise exposure. The mouse hand also moves less frequently during typing, providing a more stable recording platform. This should be a design recommendation for users.

## Appendix C: Multi-Device Architecture Consideration

Given the tradeoffs, the strongest approach may be a **multi-device ecosystem**:

1. **Primary: Wristband** -- always worn, main battery and processing, handles storage, cellular/WiFi upload, gesture interaction, adequate audio for conversations and meetings
2. **Optional: Clip-on booster mic** -- a small lavalier-style clip that can be worn on the collar when audio quality matters (important meetings, presentations). Connects to wristband via BLE. Used situationally, not all day.
3. **Future: Smart ring** -- ultra-discreet secondary mic and gesture device, sending audio to wristband for processing

This modular approach lets users choose their audio quality vs. convenience tradeoff on a per-situation basis, while the wristband ensures continuous baseline recording.
